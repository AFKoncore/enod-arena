# AHK script for Warframe Endo Arena
The most useful feature is a sound notification when your Vazarin Sling's shield effect or Khora's cage is about to run out. Also includes melee attack spam and a couple other small things.
___
This AHK scripts uses Auto Hot Key v1.1 https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe

Please review the code for yourself, learn the script hotkeys, and edit it so it fits your warframe in game keybinds and ability duration for Khora. You can open enod arena.ahk with any text editor. (I suggest using Notepad++)

Feel free to steal code snipets or edit & improve the script, it's still a work in progress.
